# 🎙️ Podium — Public Speaking Studio

**The Spoken-First Studio — A Four-Week College Public Speaking Course That Teaches, Coaches, and Grades How You Actually Speak**

---

## 🧩 Overview

Podium is a self-paced, single-user web course that delivers a full month of college public speaking — taught, drilled, and graded entirely by AI, with most assignments performed **out loud**. Instead of typing essays about communication, the student steps up to the mic, records a real spoken answer, and gets coached on both *what* they said and *how* they said it.

Read the lecture, practice against a prompt, record your response, and submit homework, tests, and a capstone speech that are transcribed and evaluated by AI — scored on content **and** delivery, with concrete, actionable feedback on every attempt.

## 🗂️ Monorepo Layout

This is a pnpm workspace. The deployable artifacts:

| Artifact | Slug | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@workspace/api-server` | `api-server` | Express API mounted at `/api`. Owns the DB, object storage, AssemblyAI transcription, Anthropic grading, and diagnostics. |
| `@workspace/speak-course` | `speak-course` | Student-facing Podium web app — the actual course. Served at the root (`/`). |
| `@workspace/speak-course-demo` | `speak-course-demo` | Screencast-style product demo video, exported as MP4 from the preview pane. |
| `@workspace/speak-course-marketing` | `speak-course-marketing` | Marketing / promo video for the product. |

Shared contracts and libraries live in `lib/` (OpenAPI spec, generated hooks/validators, etc.). See `artifacts/speak-course/README.md` and `artifacts/speak-course/BLUEPRINT.md` for product and architecture detail.

## ⚙️ Key Technical Notes

- **Spoken submission pipeline:** browser records with `MediaRecorder` → presigned upload URL → PUT to object storage → submit object path. Server transcribes via **AssemblyAI**, derives delivery metrics, and grades content + delivery via **Anthropic** (`claude-sonnet-4-5`, configurable via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`).
- **Fail-loud grading:** if transcription or evaluation fails, the response is stored as `failed` and the API returns **502** — never a fabricated grade.
- **GPTZero is diagnostics-only** here (a connectivity check), not a per-submission detector — this is an intentional, documented scope decision, not a gap.
- **Contract-first API:** one OpenAPI document is the source of truth; React Query hooks and Zod validators are generated from it.
- **Backend-only keys:** all provider keys live on the server; the browser never sees them.
